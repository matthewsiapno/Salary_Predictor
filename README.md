## Introduction 

For my first data science project, I chose to examine employment data to build a salary predictor.  
 
Websites such as [salary.com](salary.com), [payscale.com](payscale.com), or [glassdoor.com](glassdoor.com), utilize user imputed data to predict salaries among all industries. The partial screenshot below displays the wages for a staff accountant in the Los Angeles area. Given the industry, company size, and years of experience, the average salary for a Staff Accountant is $55,064.
